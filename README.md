# Django-based-Rumi-Press-Books-Distribution-web-application
The team at Rumi Press is working on distributing high-tech books on behalf of their publishers. Their book categories include Business Analytics, Python, Data Science, Math, and more. So far, they have been using spreadsheets to track the book distribution process, but they want to migrate their process to a web-based application. 

# Project Objectives
- Track book distribution expenses.  
- Increase data security and availability. 
- Customize and automate business processes.

# Approach
- I developed a CRUD* view to manage book categories (such as Business Analytics, Python, Data Science, and Math).
- Developed a CRUD* view to add book information such as the title, the author, the publishing date, the book category, and the distribution expenses. 
- Imported existing data from spreadsheets to the web app.
- Developed a report view that enables the team to view the distribution expenses of books according to their categories.
